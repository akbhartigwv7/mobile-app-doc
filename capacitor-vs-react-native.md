# ‚öñÔ∏è Capacitor vs React Native

## üîπ Capacitor (with React Web App)
Capacitor lets you wrap your existing **React web app** in a WebView and ship it as an Android/iOS app.

### ‚úÖ Pros
- **Fastest path**: You don‚Äôt need to rewrite the UI ‚Äî your React app runs inside a mobile WebView.
- **Single codebase**: Web + iOS + Android from the same React app.
- **Access to native APIs**: Camera, Push, Geolocation via Capacitor plugins.
- **Keeps web design**: If your app is already responsive, it mostly works out of the box.
- **Easy deployment**: Feels like ‚Äúwrapping‚Äù a website into an app.

### ‚ùå Cons
- **Performance limitations**: UI runs in a WebView, not as true native components ‚Üí may feel less ‚Äúnative‚Äù and slower for animations.
- **UI experience**: Looks like a web app, not a native app (unless styled carefully).
- **Advanced native features**: Harder to integrate than in React Native.
- **App size**: Larger, since it bundles WebView + app.

## üîπ React Native
React Native is a framework for building **real native mobile apps** using JavaScript/TypeScript with React syntax.

### ‚úÖ Pros
- **True native performance**: Uses actual native components (e.g., `View` ‚Üí `<UIView>`/`<Android.View>`).
- **Better mobile UX**: Looks & feels like a native app.
- **Large ecosystem**: Tons of plugins (camera, Bluetooth, AR, maps).
- **Offline-first**: Works great without internet.
- **Scalable**: Ideal if mobile app will grow complex.

### ‚ùå Cons
- **Rewrite required**: You cannot directly reuse your web UI (`div`, `span`, etc. must be replaced).
- **Different navigation**: React Router won‚Äôt work, need React Navigation.
- **Learning curve**: New styling system (StyleSheet, no CSS).
- **Two apps to maintain**: Your React web app + React Native mobile app (unless you modularize logic).

## üìä Key Comparison Table

| Feature                | Capacitor + React Web | React Native |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|--------------|
| **Code Reuse**          | 90% (UI + logic same as web) | ~50% (logic only, UI must be rewritten) |
| **Performance**         | Medium (WebView-based) | High (native components) |
| **Look & Feel**         | Web-like              | Native mobile experience |
| **Access to Native APIs** | Yes (via plugins)     | Yes (deeper + broader support) |
| **Ease of Migration**   | Very Easy (wrap app)  | Harder (rewrite UI) |
| **Offline Support**     | Limited (needs service workers, caching) | Strong (native storage, offline-first APIs) |
| **App Size**            | Larger (bundles WebView) | Smaller (native compiled) |
| **Best For**            | Quick mobile presence, MVPs, internal apps | Production-grade apps, consumer apps needing smooth UX |

## üìå When to Use What
- **Capacitor** ‚Üí If you already have a responsive React web app and want a quick mobile app with minimal effort.
- **React Native** ‚Üí If you need a **high-performance, truly native mobile experience**, or plan to scale features heavily.
